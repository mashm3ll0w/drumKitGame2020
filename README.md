# **DRUM KIT GAME 2020**

</div>

> This is a different take on the drum kit game that I made last year, but this time, using a different approach. 
> 
> This [project](https://github.com/mashm3ll0w/drum-kit-game) used a switch statement to play the trigger the sounds when the keys were pressed but this time, the project uses the pressed keys' [keyCodes](http://keycode.info/).
